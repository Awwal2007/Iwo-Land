        description: 'Speaking shortly after the Police Community Relations Committee(PCRC), Osun State appointed him as the Royal Patron in his palace, Akanbo said traditional rulers play a vital role in security and intelligence gathering. According to him: “When it comes to the community, the kings are the first. If the king is empowered, the police are empowered, and the PCRC’s work becomes easier and more effective. Unfortunately, traditional rulers are not properly funded. We spend from our resources to serve our people. That’s why I’m appealing to the government to increase our share from the LG allocation to at least 20 per cent.” He lamented the current allocation to traditional rulers is less than 5%, which he described as grossly inadequate. The Oluwo commended President Bola Tinubu’s administration for his efforts in ensuring that NIgeria’s future is secured through his policies. PCRC Chairman in Osun State, Popoola Ogundoyin said: “We confer the Royal Patron role on Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Akanbi because he is connected and has been an advocate for community security. He will further use this new assignment to influence support for the policing of our communities in the State.',
